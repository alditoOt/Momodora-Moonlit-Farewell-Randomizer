# v1.0.0 RELEASED IN THE RELEASES TAB

## Stuff I plan to add sometime
- Being able to pick if the victory condition is beating Selin or Dora; turns out dying during the credits skips them entirely, so I can make something in the mod to manually skip the credits so you can access Dora faster
- Add Windmill Key to the randomization pool (I already know how to do this) 
  - In theory, to finish the game you need: Lunar Attunement and Windmill Key to access the final area, and Double Jump and Wall Jump to traverse the final area.
  - Extra items are considered. Progressive Moonlit Dust and the two(?) items the rat king thingy gives you that unlocks the Very Big Spider (the item the spider gives when defeated could be added as well)
- Add progressive door unlock for the final boss to the randomization pool (I think this is possible...)
- Add Damage lilies to the randomization pool
- Add Healing Bell to the randomization pool
  - Since you start with this already in the inventory, not sure if it can be removed. Maybe disable the input entirely until you receive the check...?
- Add Berries to the randomization pool
  - Either separate health, magic and stamina (and black?) berries to add any of them you want, or add all of them to a single randomization pool (berrysanity?)
- Add Lumen Fairies to the randomization pool; doing this would also add the Oracle sigil to the pool
- Red Speech Bubble sanity?
- Add Companions to the randomization pool (very low on the priority list)
